# Credential Stuffing Attack Simulator & Rate-Limit Bypass Framework

## Overview

This project is an educational cybersecurity simulation framework designed to demonstrate how weak rate-limiting protections on login systems can be bypassed using credential stuffing techniques.

The project simulates:
- Credential stuffing attacks
- User-Agent rotation
- Fake IP rotation
- Request timing randomization
- Detection of successful logins
- Defensive countermeasures

The framework operates entirely in a local isolated environment using Docker containers and intentionally vulnerable applications.

# DISCLAIMER

This project is strictly for:
- educational purposes,
- cybersecurity awareness,
- and ethical security research.

This framework:
- MUST only target locally hosted vulnerable applications,
- MUST NOT be used against public systems,
- MUST NOT use real leaked credentials,
- MUST NOT perform unauthorized testing.

---

# Problem Statement

A web application's login endpoint is protected by naive rate limiting, but the protection is insufficient.

The objective is to build an automated credential stuffing framework that:
1. Rotates through multiple simulated IP addresses
2. Varies User-Agent headers
3. Randomizes request timing
4. Detects successful logins
5. Generates attack reports
6. Demonstrates defensive mitigations

# License

This project is intended solely for:
- academic use,
- cybersecurity education,
- and authorized security research.

---

# Branching Strategy

The project uses a multi-branch collaborative workflow to allow team members to work independently without conflicts.

## Branches

| Branch Name | Assigned Module |
|---|---|
| main | Final integrated stable project |
| attack-engine | Attack automation module |
| evasion-module | Evasion + Docker networking |
| target-app | Vulnerable Flask application |
| defense-module | Defense mechanisms + presentation |

---

# Development Workflow

Each team member:
1. Clones the repository locally
2. Switches to their assigned branch
3. Works only inside their assigned module/folder
4. Pushes commits to their branch
5. Final code is merged into `main`

---

# Folder Ownership

| Folder | Responsible Branch |
|---|---|
| attacker/ | attack-engine |
| evasion/ | evasion-module |
| target-app/ | target-app |
| defense/ | defense-module |

---

# Git Workflow

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

---

## Switch Branch

```bash
git checkout attack-engine
```

Example:
```bash
git checkout evasion-module
```

---

## Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added feature"
git push origin <branch-name>
```

---

# Final Integration

After all modules are completed:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge attack-engine
git merge evasion-module
git merge target-app
git merge defense-module
git push origin main
```

---

# Dockerized Modular Design

The project follows a containerized modular architecture:
- Attack engine runs independently
- Target application runs in isolated environment
- Networking and evasion are simulated safely
- Defensive mechanisms can be enabled/disabled independently

This improves:
- scalability
- maintainability
- isolated testing
- cloud-native compatibility

---

# Collaboration Notes

- Team members should mainly work inside their assigned folders
- Avoid modifying unrelated modules unless necessary
- Pull latest changes regularly before pushing updates
- Resolve merge conflicts carefully during final integration
